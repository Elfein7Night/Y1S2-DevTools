A program to manage flights in the server side and display them by a user chosen filter on the client side.

##### This project focuses on practicing:
- Code reuse, avoiding duplicates.
- Server-Client relationship.
- Development cycle with 4 "sprints" and changing "management" demands.
- Test Driven Development.
- Continuous Integration (Using ```Maven```).
- Version Control in a team environment.
- Communicating across different programming languages.
- Writing a readable "aesthetically pleasing" code (Helped by using ```Lombok```).

##### Usage:
- For 'server' side:
  - Run Java (AirportProject/Program)
  - Navigate the CLI menu
- For 'client' side:
  - Run Python (WebApp/WebApp.py)
  - Open a browser and navigate to  ``` localhost:8000 ```
